# 1 Overview

In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to compute spatial weights using R.

# 2 The Packages

# 3 The Data

Two data sets will be used in this hands-on exercise, they are:

+------------+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Type       | Name         | Details                                                            |

## 3.1 Loading Data Into R Environment

::: panel-tabset
## Import Geospatial Shapefile

The code chunk below uses [`st_read()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/st_read.html) of **sf** package to import Hunan shapefile into R. The imported shapefile will be **simple features** Object of **sf**.

```{r}
hunan <- st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", 
                 layer = "Hunan")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false

glimpse(hunan)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
# Setting theme

hunan %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),
                            fixed_thead = T)
```

## Import Aspatial csv File

Next, we will import *Hunan_2012.csv* into R by using `read_csv()` of **readr** package. The output is R dataframe class.

```{r}
hunan2012 <- read_csv("data/aspatial/Hunan_2012.csv")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
glimpse(hunan2012)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false

hunan2012 %>% 
  kable() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),
                            fixed_thead = T)
```

## Perform relational join

The code chunk below will be used to update the attribute table of *hunan*'s SpatialPolygonsDataFrame with the attribute fields of *hunan2012* dataframe. This is performed by using `left_join()` of **dplyr** package.

```{r}
colnames(hunan)
```

```{r}
colnames(hunan2012)
```

```{r}
hunan <- left_join(hunan,hunan2012)%>%
  select(1:4, 7, 15)
```
:::

## 3.2 Visualising Data

```{r}
#| echo: false
DT::datatable(hunan,
              filter = 'top',
              class = "compact",
              options = list(pageLength = 5, dom = 'tip'))
```

# 4 Visualising Regional Development Indicator

Prepare a basemap and a choropleth map to show the distribution of GDPPC 2012 (GDP per capita) by using `qtm()` of **tmap** package.

```{r}
basemap <- tm_shape(hunan) +
  tm_polygons() +
  tm_text("NAME_3", 
          size=0.3)+
  tm_layout(bg.color = "#E4D5C9",
            frame = F)

gdppc <- qtm(hunan, "GDPPC") +
  tm_layout(bg.color = "#E4D5C9",
            frame = F,
            legend.title.size = 0.8,
            legend.text.size = 0.5)

tmap_arrange(basemap, gdppc, asp=1, ncol=2)
```

# 5 Computing Contiguity/Adjacency Spatial Weights

::: {.notebox .note data-latex="note"}
**Contiguity-based**

-   Share common boundary (rooks, bishops, queen's/king's case)
-   Measured using `poly2nb()` of **spdep** package
-   Constructs neighbours list from polygon list
-   This function **builds a neighbours list** based on regions with contiguous boundaries.
-   What this function does is to build a neighbours list based on regions with contiguous boundaries - which means they're in 'contact' and share one or more boundary points. For example, on the Singapore map, the North-East region is contiguous with the North region and the East region.
-   One thing to note is the `queen` argument:
    -   TRUE (default): a single shared boundary point meets the contiguity condition
    -   FALSE: more than one shared point is required
    -   note that more than one shared boundary point does not necessarily mean a shared boundary line

**Distance-based** - Within threshold distance to the nucleus - Measured using `knn2nb()`
:::

## 5.1 Computing contiguity based neighbours

We'll be computing based on two types of contiguity: Queen and Rook. If you're a chess buff (or even a chess amateur), these terms will sound familiar to you: and as you might've guessed, they're related to the positions the queen and rook can move on a chess board.

::: panel-tabset \## Queen

The code chunk below is used to compute Queen contiguity weight matrix.

```{r}
wm_q <- poly2nb(hunan, queen=TRUE)
summary(wm_q)
```

::: {.lightbox .light data-latex="light"}
**Interpretation**

-   There are 88 area units in Hunan.
-   Most connected area unit has 11 neighbours.
-   There are 2 area units with only 1 neighbour.
:::

## Rook

The code chunk below is used to compute Rook contiguity weight matrix.

```{r}
wm_r <- poly2nb(hunan, queen=FALSE)
summary(wm_r)
```

::: {.lightbox .light data-latex="light"}
**Interpretation**

-   There are 88 area units in Hunan.
-   Most connect area unit has 10 neighbours.
-   There are 2 area units with only 1 neighbour.
:::

### 5.1.1 Display Neighbours for Specific County

For each polygon in our polygon object, `wm_q()` lists all neighboring polygons. For example, to see the neighbors for the first polygon in the object, type:

```{r}
wm_q[[1]]
```

```{r}
wm_r[[1]]
```

Polygon 1 has 5 neighbors. The **numbers** represent the **polygon IDs** as stored in Hunan SpatialPolygonsDataFrame class.

### 5.1.2 Retrieve County Name of Polygon ID=1

```{r}
hunan$County[1]
```

The output reveals that Polygon ID=1 is Anxiang county.

### 5.1.3 Reveal county names of neighboring polygons

```{r}
hunan$NAME_3[c(2,3,4,57,85)]
```

### 5.1.4 Retrieve GDPCC

We can retrieve the GDPPC of these five counties by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
nb1 <- wm_q[[1]]
nb1 <- hunan$GDPPC[nb1]
nb1
```

```{r}
nb2 <- wm_r[[1]]
nb2 <- hunan$GDPPC[nb2]
nb2
```

### 5.1.5 Display the complete weight matrix

The printed output above shows that the GDPPC of the five nearest neighbours based on Queen's method are 20981, 34592, 24473, 21311 and 22879 respectively.

You can display the complete weight matrix by using `str()`.

```{r}
str(wm_q)
```

## 5.2 Visualising contiguity weights

-   A connectivity graph takes a point and displays a line to each neighboring point.
-   As we are working with polygons, we need to get points in order to make the **connectivity graphs**.
-   Most typical method: **polygon centroids**
    -   Calculate these in the sf package before moving onto the graphs
    -   Getting Latitude and Longitude of Polygon Centroids
    -   It is a little more complicated than just running `st_centroid` on the sf object as we need to get the coordinates in a separate data frame..
-   **Mapping function**: applies a given function to each element of a vector and returns a vector of the same length.
-   **input vector**: will be the geometry column of us.bound.
-   **function** will be `st_centroid`.
-   Use **map_dbl** variation of map from the purrr package

### 5.2.1 Get Long & Lat

::: panel-tabset
## Long

-   To get our longitude values, we map the `st_centroid` function over the geometry column of us.bound and access the longitude value through double bracket notation \[\[\]\] and 1.
-   Allows us to get only the longitude, which is the first value in each centroid.

```{r}
longitude <- map_dbl(hunan$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[1]])
```

## Lat

-   Do the same for latitude with one key difference.
-   We access the second value per each centroid with \[\[2\]\]

```{r}
latitude <- map_dbl(hunan$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[2]])
```

## Combine Long & Lat

`cbind()` to put longitude and latitude into the same object.

```{r}
coords <- cbind(longitude, latitude)
```

## Check

We check the first few observations to see if things are formatted correctly.

```{r}
head(coords)
```
:::

### 5.2.2 Plotting contiguity-based neighbours map

```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=8}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

par(bg = '#E4D5C9')

par(mfrow=c(1,2))

plot(hunan$geometry, 
     border="#b89c8c", 
     main="Queen Contiguity")
plot(wm_q, 
     coords, 
     pch = 19, 
     cex = 0.6, 
     add = TRUE, 
     col= "red")

plot(hunan$geometry, 
     border="#b89c8c", 
     main="Rook Contiguity")
plot(wm_r, 
     coords, 
     pch = 19, 
     cex = 0.6, 
     add = TRUE, 
     col = "red")
```

::: {.lightbox .light data-latex="light"}
**Note**

-   There is actually a difference if you look closely at the bottom right of Queen Contiguity plot.
-   There is 2 extra vertices at the bottom right.
:::

# 6 Computing distance-based neighbours

-   Derive **distance-based weight matrices** by using `dnearneigh()` of spdep package
-   The function identifies neighbours of region points by Euclidean distance with a distance band with **lower d1= and upper d2= bounds** controlled by the bounds= argument.
-   If unprojected coordinates are used and either specified in the coordinates object x or with x as a two column matrix and longlat=TRUE, great circle distances in km will be calculated assuming the WGS84 reference ellipsoid.

### 6.2.1 Determine the cut-off distance / upper limit

To determine the upper limit for distance band:

|          |                                                                                                                             |                             |

+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+

: {tbl-colwidths="\[5,65,30\]"}

::: panel-tabset
## Create neighbour list

-   [`knearneigh()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/knearneigh.html) of **spdep**: returns a matrix with the indices of points belonging to the set of the k nearest neighbours of each other.
-   [`knn2nb()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/knn2nb.html): converts the knn object returned by `knearneigh()` into a neighbours list (class nb) with a list of integer vectors containing neighbour region number ids.

```{r}
knearneigh(coords)
```

```{r}
k1 <- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords))
k1
```

## Calculate distance

-   [`nbdists()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/nbdists.html) of **spdep**: calculates the length of neighbour relationship edges (ie distance between neighboring regions). Returns units of the coordinates if the coordinates are projected, in km otherwise.
-   [`unlist()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/unlist): removes the list structure of the returned object by using .

```{r}
nbdists(k1, coords, longlat = TRUE)
```

```{r}
k1dists <- unlist(nbdists(k1, coords, longlat = TRUE))
k1dists
```

## Obtain upper limit

```{r}
summary(k1dists)
```
:::

::: {.lightbox .light data-latex="light"}
**Interpretation**

The summary report shows that the largest first nearest neighbour distance is 61.79 km, so using this as the upper threshold gives certainty that all units will have at least one neighbour.
:::

### 6.2.2 Computing fixed distance weight matrix

`dnearneigh()` is used to compute the distance weight matrix.

```{r}
wm_d62 <- dnearneigh(coords, 0, 62, longlat = TRUE)
wm_d62
```

**Interpretation**

88 regions in Hunan, 324 links amongst regions of distance up to 62km, Avg of 3-4 neighbours within this distance

:::

To display the structure of *wm_d62* weight matrix:

::: panel-tabset
## str()

```{r}
str(wm_d62)
```

## table() & card()

Another way to display the structure of the weight matrix is to combine [`table()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/table) and [`card()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/card.html) of **spdep**.

```{r}
table(hunan$County, 
       # list number of neighbours for each area
      card(wm_d62))
```
:::

`n.comp.nb()` finds the number of disjoint connected subgraphs in the graph depicted by `nb.obj()` - a spatial neighbours list object.

```{r}
n_comp <- n.comp.nb(wm_d62)
n_comp$nc
```

```{r}
table(n_comp$comp.id)
```

## 6.2.3 Plotting fixed distance weight matrix

The red lines show the links of 1st nearest neighbours and the black lines show the links of neighbours within the cut-off distance of 62km.

```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=8}

par(bg = '#E4D5C9')
par(mfrow=c(1,2))

plot(hunan$geometry, 
     border="#b89c8c", 
     main="1st nearest neighbours")
plot(k1, 
     coords, 
     add=TRUE, 
     col="#909690",
     pch = 19,
     length=0.6)

plot(hunan$geometry, 
     border="#b89c8c", 
     main="Distance link")
plot(wm_d62, 
     coords, 
     add=TRUE, 
     col="#bd5f5a", 
     pch = 19, 
     cex = 0.6)
```

### 6.2.4 Computing adaptive distance weight matrix

-   For fixed distance weight matrix, more densely settled areas (usually urban areas) tend to have more neighbours and the less densely settled areas (usually rural counties) tend to have lesser neighbours.

-   Having many neighbours smoothes the neighbour relationship across more neighbours.

::: panel-tabset
## Control the numbers of neighbours directly

-   It is possible to control the numbers of neighbours directly using k-nearest neighbours (where *k=n* as specified), either accepting asymmetric neighbours or imposing symmetry.

```{r}
knn6 <- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords, k=6))
knn6
```

Similarly, we can display the content of the matrix by using `str()`.

```{r}
str(knn6)
```

Each county will have exactly six neighbours as specified.

## Plotting distance based neighbours

We can plot the weight matrix using the code chunk below.

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
par(bg = '#E4D5C9')

plot(hunan$geometry, 
     border="#b89c8c")
plot(knn6, 
     coords, 
     pch = 18, 
     cex = 0.6, 
     add = TRUE, 
     col = "#A70D04")
```
:::

# 7 Inversed Distance Weights

## Step 1: Compute Distance between Areas using `nbdists()` of **spdep**

```{r}
dist <- nbdists(wm_q, 
                coords, 
                longlat = TRUE)

ids <- lapply(dist, function(x) 1/(x))
ids
```

## Step 2: Row-standardised weights matrix

::: {.notebox .note data-latex="note"}
**nb2listw()**

-   Assign weights to each neighboring polygon. Recall in lecture slides, it is calculated using the inverse of number of neigbours; total of each row in matrix adds to 1, which makes it a row-standardized.
-   In our case study, each neighboring polygon will be **assigned equal weight** (`style="W"`). This is accomplished by assigning the fraction 1/(# of neighbours) to each neighboring county then summing the weighted income values.
-   While this is the most intuitive way to summaries the neighbors' values it has one drawback in that polygons along the edges of the study area will base their lagged values on fewer polygons thus potentially over- or under-estimating the true nature of the spatial autocorrelation in the data.
-   `Style="W"` option used for this example for simplicity's sake but more robust options are available, notably `style="B"`.
-   Styles:
    -   W: row standardised (sums over all links to n)
    -   B: basic binary coding
    -   C: globally standardised (sums over all links to n)
    -   U: equal to C divided by the number of neighbours (sums over all links to unity)
    -   S: variance-stabilizing coding scheme (sums over all links to n)
    -   minmax: divides the weights by min of the max row sums and max column sums of the input weights; similar to C/U
-   `nb2listw()` converts a neighbors list object into a weight list object.
-   The input of `nb2listw()` must be an object of class **nb**. The syntax of the function has two major arguments, namely style and zero.poly.

## W (Equal Weight)

rswm_q <- nb2listw(wm_q, 
                   style="W", 
                   zero.policy = TRUE)

rswm_q
```

## B (Binary Coding)

```{r}
rswm_qB <- nb2listw(wm_q, style="B", zero.policy = TRUE)
rswm_qB
```

## Zero.Policy = FALSE

```{r}
rswm_qF <- nb2listw(wm_q, style="W", zero.policy = FALSE)
rswm_qF
```
:::

-   `zero.policy = TRUE`: allows for lists of non-neighbors. This should be used with caution since the user may not be aware of missing neighbors in their dataset however, a `zero.policy = FALSE` would return an error.
    -   If *zero policy* is set to TRUE, weights vectors of zero length are inserted for regions without neighbour in the neighbours list. These will in turn generate lag values of zero, equivalent to the sum of products of the zero row t(rep(0, length=length(neighbours))) %\*% x, for arbitrary numerical vector x of length length(neighbours). The spatially lagged value of x for the zero-neighbour region will then be zero, which may (or may not) be a sensible choice.

To see the weight of the first polygon's eight neighbors type:

```{r}
rswm_q$weights[10]
```

-   Each neighbor is assigned a 0.125 of the total weight. All same because style="W" =\> equal weights.
-   This means that when R computes the average neighboring income values, each neighbor's income will be multiplied by 0.2 before being tallied.
-   Using the same method, we can also derive a row standardised distance weight matrix by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
rswm_ids <- nb2listw(wm_q, 
                     glist=ids, 
                     style="B", 
                     zero.policy=TRUE)
rswm_ids
```

```{r}
rswm_ids$weights[1]
```

```{r}
summary(unlist(rswm_ids$weights))
```

# 8 Application of Spatial Weight Matrix

Spatially lagged variable: the weighted sum or a weighted average of the neighboring values for that variable. Used to account for spatial autocorrelation in the data, where values of a variable in 1 location is influenced by values of variable in the nearby locations

***4 different spatial lagged variables:***

-   spatial lag with row-standardized weights
-   spatial lag as a sum of neighbouring values
-   spatial window average, and
-   spatial window sum

## 8.1 Spatial lag with row-standardized weights

-   Sums up GDPPC of all the neighbours, except the target location itself
-   Here, we compute the average neighbor GDPPC value for each polygon.
-   These values are often referred to as **spatially lagged values**

::: panel-tabset
## Compute the avg neighbor GDPPC value

-   These values are often referred to as **spatially lagged values**.

```{r}
GDPPC.lag <- lag.listw(rswm_q, hunan$GDPPC)
GDPPC.lag
```

## Append spatially lag GDPPC values onto hunan SpatialPolygonDataFrame

```{r}
lag.list <- list(hunan$NAME_3, 
                 lag.listw(rswm_q, hunan$GDPPC))
lag.res <- as.data.frame(lag.list)
colnames(lag.res) <- c("NAME_3", "lag GDPPC")
hunan <- left_join(hunan,
                   lag.res)
```

The following table shows the average neighboring income values (stored in the Inc.lag object) for each county.

```{r}
head(hunan)
```

## Plot both the GDPPC and spatial lag GDPPC

```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=8}

gdppc <- qtm(hunan, "GDPPC") +
    tm_layout(bg.color = "#E4D5C9",
            frame = F)

lag_gdppc <- qtm(hunan, "lag GDPPC") +
    tm_layout(bg.color = "#E4D5C9",
            frame = F)

tmap_arrange(gdppc, 
             lag_gdppc, 
             asp=1, 
             ncol=2) 
```
:::

## 8.2 Spatial lag as a sum of neighboring values

We can calculate spatial lag as a sum of neighboring values by assigning binary weights. This requires us to go back to our neighbors list, then apply a function that will assign binary weights, then we use `glist =` in the **nb2listw** function to explicitly assign these weights.

::: panel-tabset
## Create binary spatial weights matrix

-   We start by applying a function that will assign a value of 1 per each neighbor.
-   This is done with `lapply`, which we have been using to manipulate the neighbors structure throughout the past notebooks.
-   Basically it applies a function across each value in the neighbors structure.

```{r}
b_weights <- lapply(wm_q, function(x) 0*x + 1)
b_weights2 <- nb2listw(wm_q, 
                       glist = b_weights, 
                       style = "B")
b_weights2
```

## Compute lag variable

With the proper weights assigned, we can use `lag.listw` to compute a lag variable from our weight and GDPPC.

```{r}
lag_sum <- list(hunan$NAME_3, lag.listw(b_weights2, hunan$GDPPC))
lag.res <- as.data.frame(lag_sum)
colnames(lag.res) <- c("NAME_3", "lag_sum GDPPC")
```

```{r}
lag_sum
```

## Append lag_sum GDPPC into hunan

Next, we will append the *lag_sum GDPPC* field into *hunan* sf data frame by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
hunan <- left_join(hunan, lag.res)
```

## Plot & Compare

Now, We can plot both the *GDPPC* and *Spatial Lag Sum GDPPC* for comparison using the code chunk below.

```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=8}
gdppc <- qtm(hunan, "GDPPC") +
    tm_layout(bg.color = "#E4D5C9",
            frame = F)

lag_sum_gdppc <- qtm(hunan, "lag_sum GDPPC") +
    tm_layout(bg.color = "#E4D5C9",
            frame = F)

tmap_arrange(gdppc, lag_sum_gdppc, asp=1, ncol=2)
```
:::

## 8.3 Spatial window average

The spatial window average uses row-standardized weights and includes the diagonal element. To do this in R, we need to go back to the neighbors structure and add the diagonal element before assigning weights.

::: panel-tabset
## Add diagonal element

To add the diagonal element to the neighbour list, we just need to use `include.self()` from **spdep**.

```{r}
wm_qs <- include.self(wm_q)
wm_qs
```

Notice that the Number of nonzero links, Percentage nonzero weights and Average number of links are 536, 6.921488 and 6.090909 respectively as compared to wm_q of 448, 5.785124 and 5.090909

Let us take a good look at the neighbour list of area \[1\] by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
wm_qs[[1]]
```

Notice that now \[1\] has six neighbours instead of five.

## Create spatial weights list

Now we obtain weights with `nb2listw()`

```{r}
wm_qs <- nb2listw(wm_qs)
wm_qs
```

Again, we use `nb2listw()` and `glist()` to explicitly assign weight values.

## Create lag variable

Lastly, we just need to create the lag variable from our weight structure and GDPPC variable.

```{r}
lag_w_avg_gpdpc <- lag.listw(wm_qs, 
                             hunan$GDPPC)
lag_w_avg_gpdpc
```

## Convert to data frame

Next, we will convert the lag variable listw object into a data.frame by using `as.data.frame()`.

```{r}
lag.list.wm_qs <- list(hunan$NAME_3, lag.listw(wm_qs, hunan$GDPPC))
lag_wm_qs.res <- as.data.frame(lag.list.wm_qs)
colnames(lag_wm_qs.res) <- c("NAME_3", "lag_window_avg GDPPC")
```

Note: The third command line on the code chunk above renames the field names of *lag_wm_q1.res* object into *NAME_3* and *lag_window_avg GDPPC* respectively.

## Left join

Next, the code chunk below will be used to append *lag_window_avg GDPPC* values onto *hunan* sf data.frame by using `left_join()` of **dplyr** package.

```{r}
hunan <- left_join(hunan, lag_wm_qs.res)
```

## Compare

To compare the values of lag GDPPC and Spatial window average, `kable()` of Knitr package is used to prepare a table using the code chunk below.

```{r}
hunan %>%
  select("County", 
         "lag GDPPC", 
         "lag_window_avg GDPPC") %>%
  kable() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),
                            fixed_thead = T)
```

## Plot

Lastly, `qtm()` of **tmap** package is used to plot the lag_gdppc and w_ave_gdppc maps next to each other for quick comparison.

```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=8}
w_avg_gdppc <- qtm(hunan, "lag_window_avg GDPPC") +
  tm_layout(bg.color = "#E4D5C9",
            frame = F)

tmap_arrange(lag_gdppc, w_avg_gdppc, asp=1, ncol=2)
```
:::

Note: For more effective comparison, it is advicible to use the core tmap mapping functions.

## 8.4 Spatial window sum

-   The spatial window sum is the counter part of the window average, but without using row-standardized weights.
-   Uses and includes the diagonal element.
-   Sums up GDPPC of all neighbours, including target location itself

::: panel-tabset
## Add diagonal element

To add the diagonal element to the neighbour list, we just need to use `include.self()` from **spdep**.

```{r}
wm_qs <- include.self(wm_q)
wm_qs
```

## Assign weights

Next, we will assign **binary** weights to the neighbour structure that includes the diagonal element.

```{r}
b_weights <- lapply(wm_qs, function(x) 0*x + 1)
b_weights[1]
```

Notice that now \[1\] has six neighbours instead of five.

Again, we use `nb2listw()` and `glist()` to explicitly assign weight values.

```{r}
b_weights2 <- nb2listw(wm_qs, 
                       glist = b_weights, 
                       style = "B")
b_weights2
```

## Compute lag variable

With our new weight structure, we can compute the lag variable with l`ag.listw()`.

```{r}
w_sum_gdppc <- list(hunan$NAME_3, lag.listw(b_weights2, hunan$GDPPC))
w_sum_gdppc
```

## Convert to data frame

Next, we will convert the lag variable listw object into a data.frame by using `as.data.frame()`.

```{r}
w_sum_gdppc.res <- as.data.frame(w_sum_gdppc)
colnames(w_sum_gdppc.res) <- c("NAME_3", "w_sum GDPPC")
```

Note: The second command line on the code chunk above renames the field names of *w_sum_gdppc.res* object into *NAME_3* and *w_sum GDPPC* respectively.

## Left join

Next, the code chunk below will be used to append *w_sum GDPPC* values onto *hunan* sf data.frame by using `left_join()` of **dplyr** package.

```{r}
hunan <- left_join(hunan, w_sum_gdppc.res)
```

## Compare

To compare the values of lag GDPPC and Spatial window average, `kable()` of Knitr package is used to prepare a table using the code chunk below.

```{r}
hunan %>%
  select("County", "lag_sum GDPPC", "w_sum GDPPC") %>%
  kable() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"),
                            fixed_thead = T)

```

## Plot

Lastly, `qtm()` of **tmap** package is used to plot the lag_sum GDPPC and w_sum_gdppc maps next to each other for quick comparison.

```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=8}
w_sum_gdppc <- qtm(hunan, "w_sum GDPPC") +
  tm_layout(bg.color = "#E4D5C9",
            frame = F)

tmap_arrange(lag_sum_gdppc, w_sum_gdppc, asp=1, ncol=2)
```
